# WhatsApp Group Newsletter Platform

## Overview
This project is a platform that allows users to integrate their WhatsApp groups and receive a weekly newsletter. It features a robust architecture that includes user management, WhatsApp API integration, content generation, and scheduling functionalities.

## Architecture

### Frontend: React with Next.js
- **React with Next.js**:
  - Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for better performance and SEO.
  - Simplified routing and API handling.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**:
  - Consistent and scalable component styling.
  - Theming capabilities for cohesive design.

### Backend: Node.js with Express
- **Node.js with Express**:
  - Lightweight and flexible web application framework.
  - Easy API creation and integration with the frontend.
- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB or PostgreSQL** for storing user data, group information, and newsletter content.

### API Communication
- **REST API** for simplicity or **GraphQL** for flexible data querying.
- Integration with WhatsApp API for sending newsletters.

### User Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication.
- Role-based access control if needed.

### Dynamic Content Generation
- Integration with ChatGPT or another content generation API.
- Fetching and injecting dynamic content into newsletters.

### Scheduling and Automation
- **Cron Jobs** or **Task Schedulers** for automating weekly newsletter delivery.

### CI/CD and Testing
- **CI/CD Pipelines** for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Set Up Monorepo and Containerization
1. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Use a tool like Nx or Lerna to manage both frontend and backend in a single repository.
2. **Docker**:
   - Create Dockerfiles for frontend and backend.
   - Configure `docker-compose` to manage and orchestrate services.

### Step 2: Initialize Frontend with Next.js and MUI
1. **Create Next.js Project**:
   - Initialize a Next.js project within the `frontend` package.
2. **Install MUI**:
   - Install and configure MUI for theming and component styling.

### Step 3: Initialize Backend with Node.js and Express
1. **Create Express App**:
   - Initialize an Express app within the `backend` package.
2. **Set Up Database**:
   - Configure MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
   - Create schemas/models for user data, group information, and newsletter content.

### Step 4: User Authentication and Management
1. **JWT Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT-based authentication in the backend.
   - Create login, registration, and user management endpoints.
2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Set up authentication flows in the React frontend using Next.js.

### Step 5: WhatsApp API Integration
1. **WhatsApp Business API**:
   - Register and set up the WhatsApp Business API.
   - Create endpoints in the backend for managing WhatsApp groups and sending messages.
2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Allow users to link their WhatsApp groups via the frontend.

### Step 6: Dynamic Content Generation
1. **Integrate ChatGPT or Similar API**:
   - Create endpoints to fetch and generate dynamic content for newsletters.
2. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Display generated content in the frontend and allow users to customize it.

### Step 7: Scheduling and Automation
1. **Cron Jobs**:
   - Set up cron jobs in the backend to automate weekly newsletter generation and delivery.
2. **Task Scheduler**:
   - Ensure tasks run reliably and handle errors gracefully.

### Step 8: CI/CD and Testing
1. **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
2. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for frontend and backend components.
   - Implement integration tests to ensure the entire flow works seamlessly.
   - Use end-to-end testing tools like Cypress to test the full user journey.
